# Calculator developed in Kotlin

This was my first contact with mobile programming using Kotlin. The calc is basic, but it was the first project I did. Later on I will fix some bugs that I discovered.


> Currently you can only use one opereator at a time, it does not allow you to do an sum and multiply  at the same time. In the future, I will add this option.
