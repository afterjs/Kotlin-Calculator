# Calculator developed in Kotlin

This was my first contact with mobile programming using Kotlin. The calc is basic, but it was the first project I did. Later on I will fix some bugs that I discovered.


> Currently you can only use one opereator at a time, it does not allow you to do an sum and multiply  at the same time. In the future, I will add this option.


Some initial photos of the project:

<table>
  <tr>
     <td> <img src="/Assets/mobile2.jpg" width="150" heigth="300"></td>
      <td><img src="/Assets/mobile1.jpg" width="150" heigth="300"></td>
      <img src="/Assets/xml.jpg" width="350" heigth="300"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
